	A better API for common touch screen gestures.
	
	Maybe a better package name. 
	
	For example http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1071 explains some common gestures.
	It should be easy to write listeners that react to these gestures.
	
	In the class design, I follow the well-known Java-Beans and Java Swing and AWT more closely than the Android API.
	
	I restrict myself to Android API level 7 because there are still many devices with that level.
	
	Make your touch listener and register it with a touch dispatcher:
	<pre>
		TouchListener listener=new TouchAdapter(){
			//Override the methods you need
		};
		TouchDispatcher dispatcher=newTouchDispatcher();
		dispatcher.addTouchListener(listener);
	</pre>
	
	Then let your view's onTouchEvent() call the dispatcher:
	<pre>
		@Override public void onTouchEvent(MotionEvent e){
			dispatcher.onTouchEvent(this, e);
		}
	</pre>
	
	Or set the dispatcher as the OnTouchListener of the view:
	<pre>
		view.setOnTouchListener(dispatcher);
	</pre>
